1. PatternSense — A Computation Theory of Structural Identity

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17716891
Scope:
Defines identity as a computable pattern maintained by a distributed coherence field rather than a substance or location. Introduces attractor geometry, coherence fields, basin depth, deformation thresholds, and general criteria for structural continuity. Establishes the foundational mathematics and terminology used in the subsequent papers.

Core contribution:  A universal, system-agnostic geometry of identity.

2. Operational Definition of Episodic Identity (ODEI)

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17766282
What it addresses:   How an identity persists within a basin when subjected to drift, stress, and environmental change.
ODEI provides an operational test for identity continuity through deformation and introduces the elasticity threshold (α̂): the point beyond which identity cannot self-restore without a structural shift.

Core contribution:  A measurable operational test for “sameness” across episodes or perturbations.

3. Architecture vs Substrate Framework (ArchvSubst)

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17769472
What it addresses:  How the substrate (biological, computational, institutional) shapes the architecture of identity.
This paper formalizes the distinction between substrate-dependent and architecture-dependent coherence, showing that identity can be preserved across substrates if the architecture of coherence remains invariant.

Core contribution:  A taxonomy of structural invariants and constraints across different substrates.

4. Identity-Discontinuous Transformation (IDT)

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17784042
What it addresses:  What happens when identity leaves its own basin entirely.
IDT distinguishes two thresholds:

α̂ — elasticity limit (from ODEI)

α† — topological identity boundary, beyond which the original basin no longer exists

The paper introduces the meta-coherence operator (Ω), the mechanism by which an identity can reconstitute after discontinuity, and characterizes three mechanisms governing basin exit:

Φc — contradiction density (destabilizes)

Ψp — prospective coherence (directs)

Λa — authorship (re-authors)

Core contribution:  A formal geometry of metamorphosis versus dissolution.

Conceptual Map (at a glance)

PatternSense: Defines what identity is — a structural attractor in a coherence field.
ODEI: Explains how identity persists or deforms within its basin.
Arch v Subst: Explains what constraints arise from the underlying substrate.
IDT: Explains how identity exits, loses, and reconstitutes basins.

Together, the four pieces form a coherent theory of identity across continuity, deformation, substrate variation, and discontinuity.

How to Use This Series

Researchers and practitioners can use these papers to:

- analyze identity formation in artificial agents, biological organisms, and organizations
- diagnose when a system is deforming versus discontinuously transforming
- understand how substrate constraints shape identity
- design architectures capable of maintaining or reconstituting identity under stress
- interpret large-scale shifts in institutions, technologies, and ecosystems through a unified geometry of coherence
